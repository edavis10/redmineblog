If you were wanting to evaluate Redmine without having to set it up or wanted to try out some of the new features coming in 0.9, the [Redmine demo][demo] is now back online.  I've set it up on [Heroku][] using their free plan and a [PostgreSQL][] database.  This demo is different from the old one in two critical ways:

1. it's running a newer version of the Redmine trunk (r2784) so you can evaluate the new features that have been added recently
2. it's been setup to give registered users the ability to create their own projects.  This means once you register, you can create your own project on there and try out the project administration features

So if setting up Redmine has held you back from evaluating Redmine, fear no longer as the demo server is waiting for you.  If you do decide to start using Redmine and would like some help setting it up, [send me an email][contact] and I'll see what I can do to help.
