During the [Team Lead Meeting][dev1] this morning we decided that it would be useful to have a calendar of the Redmine community events.  I've created a [Google Calendar][cal] and entered some of the upcoming events in the community.  If you know of an event about Redmine, please [contact me][] and I'll add it to the [calendar][cal].
