[Redmine 1.0.1][release] has been released to [Rubyforge](http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=1850).  This is the first non release candidate for the 1.0 version of Redmine.  With over 57 changes since [Redmine 1.0](http://redmineblog.com/articles/redmine-1.0.0-released), this should be a very stable release.  Upgrading is recommended for all 0.9.x and 1.0.0 users.

The [upgrade documentation][upgrade] will help you perform the upgrade. If anything goes wrong or you need help, feel free to post in the [forums][] or [IRC] channel.
