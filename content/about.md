The [RedmineBlog.com][blog] is a blog about the [Redmine Project Management application][redmine] and it's community.  We will be writing about various components of Redmine and it's community including:

* [Community news][community]
* [Detailed feature reviews][code]
* [Plugin reviews][plugins]
* [Community interviews][community]

We will try to make our content general enough to be used by anyone who currently runs Redmine or is evaluating Redmine, but we are targeting a few specific types of users to start:

* Seasoned Redmine users who are looking for regular updates and upcoming news
* New users who need detailed information on a specific topic
* Ruby on Rails developers who are wanting to get into Redmine development

The site is run by Eric Davis of Little Stream Software with contributions from the Redmine community.  We would love to hear your suggestions about the site or any new story ideas at our [community project][1].
