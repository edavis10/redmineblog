I'm organizing the first Redmine [BugMash][] this weekend.  It's loosely based off the [Rails Bridge BugMash][rb] with the goals of:

1. cleaning up Redmine for the 1.0 release and
2. getting more people contributing to Redmine

I'll be working on the [Wiki pages][bugmash] for the event as well as putting together a [list of issues][issues] I'd like to resolve.  If you have some time and would just to join, stop by [irc][] this weekend and we'll help you get started.
