[![Wireframe of the proposed UI][img]][forum]

Shane Pearlman from the [Redmine UX team][UX] has created some wireframes for his proposed changes to Redmine's File and Document modules. The Redmine teams are thinking about merging the two modules together into a single Media Library module.  The UX team is still looking for more feedback on the designs.  If you are a heavy user of these modules or want to help contribute to Redmine's direction, please reply on the [forum thread][forum].
