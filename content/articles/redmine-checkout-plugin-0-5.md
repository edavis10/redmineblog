![Redmine Checkout](http://redmineblog.com/assets/2010/7/redmine_checkout.png)

Today [Holger Just][] released an update to his [Redmine Checkout plugin][plugin].  This plugin adds additional information to the Repository module in Redmine:

* The url to get a copy of entire repository
* The url to get only the currently shown code (e.g. stable branch)
* Instructions on how to use the repository (e.g. scm client instructions)

I think this adds a great feature to Redmine's Repository module, especially for open source and public projects. I'd like to see this added to [Redmine.org](http://www.redmine.org).
