Last night I migrated [RedmineBlog.com][blog] to the [Jekyll][] engine.  The blog has been running on [Mephisto][] but I was finding it difficult to actually write due to the various the bugs in Mephisto.  Jekyll will make this easier, so I'm hoping to post more frequently.  I converted all of the comments to [Disqus][], so the previous conversations are still available.  Disqus is a hosted commenting service which has a lot more features than the built in ones in the old blog.  I'm hoping this will make this site more valuable to each of you.

I'm still tweaking the blog a little bit and will be fixing the smaller bugs as I find them.  If you notice anything, please post a comment here or open a [bug report][] for me.  Thanks

Eric Davis
