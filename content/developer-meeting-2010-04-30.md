We have picked a date and time for the first [Redmine Developer meeting][meeting].  It will be held on [irc][] at 2010-04-30 at 14:00 UTC ([check your local time][time]).  Everyone is welcome to attend and participate:

* Developers
* Contributors
* Plugin developers
* Users
* People interested in getting involved in the Redmine community
* Others who have nothing better to listen to on Friday

I'm hoping this meeting will help communicate the overall vision of the Redmine project and also involve more of the community in the project.  I hope I can see you there.
