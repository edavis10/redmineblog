**UPDATE:** The final meeting times have been decided on, see my [update](http://redmineblog.com/articles/developer-meeting-2010-04-30/) for more information.


There is a [discussion][] about a Redmine developer meeting at the end of the month.  Everyone is welcome to attend and we are currently collecting discussion topics on the [wiki][].  We are hoping to schedule these regularly in order to have more community involvement in the decision making process.

Once the final date and time have been decided, I'll update this post.
