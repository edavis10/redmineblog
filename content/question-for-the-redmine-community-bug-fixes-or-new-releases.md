I wanted to make a short post to ask for some feedback on a question I just posted my [development blog][blog]. I asked which people would prefer: "Bug fix releases to my existing plugins or the release of new plugins that are complete?"

If you have a minute, I'd love to hear what you think.  You can leave a comment here or on my [original blog post][blog].

Thank you.
