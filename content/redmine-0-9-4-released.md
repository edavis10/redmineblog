Redmine 0.9.4 was posted to Rubyforge over the weekend.  This is a release for the 0.9.x series of Redmine that includes [54 bugfixes][] and some security fixes since the [0.9.3][] release.  All users are recommended to upgrade, by following the [upgrade process][upgrade] on the Redmine wiki.

If you are running the trunk version of Redmine, we also recommended that you upgrade too in order to get the security fixes.
