On January 9th, Jean-Philippe released the first release candidate for [Redmine 0.9][0.9].  This is a preview release intended to catch any final bugs before the official stable release.  If you have been waiting to use the new features of Redmine 0.9, now would be the best time to upgrade your testing and staging systems.

If you find a new bug, please report it to the [issue tracker][].  We're hoping to have the next release in a couple of weeks, either another release candidate or the stable 0.9 release.
