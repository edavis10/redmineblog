It's out, it's out.  Redmine 1.0 is [released][release]!

The first release candidate for [Redmine 1.0](http://www.redmine.org/versions/show/14) has been released to [Rubyforge](http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=1850).  This is a major release which includes many new features and bugfixes since the last major release, ([0.9 in 2010-01-09][0.9]).

This is still considered a *release candidate* (RC) release.  The code has been stabilized over the past 6 weeks and we believe it is ready to be tested in production, but there still might be some rough edges.  We are using this release to get some for final feedback, both for [1.0.1][] (bug fixes) and our next major release [1.1.0][].

When you are ready to upgrade, the [upgrade documentation][upgrade] has been updated and we have people in the [forums](http://www.redmine.org/projects/redmine/boards) and [IRC][] channel to help out.

Finally, I personally wanted to thank everyone who has helped Redmine over the past [four years](http://www.redmine.org/projects/redmine/repository/revisions/1).  Without everyone's contribution, the project wouldn't be as awesome as it is now.
