I recently had to opportunity to work with Joe Clarke of [SourceRepo.com][1] to add [Redmine][redmine] to their service.  [SourceRepo.com][1] provides source code repository hosting for Git, SVN, and Mercurial.  Now, depending on the plan you choose, you will have access to a full Redmine 0.8 install.  SourceRepo.com also has an exclusive feature for Redmine right now.  It will be released to the general community soon but if you want to try it out, you will need to sign up for an account.  I'll give you a hint, it has to do with "themes" and "uploading".

I'm happy to have another company support [Redmine][redmine] and provide an easy way for users to get Redmine up and running.  If you are looking for a place to host your Redmine, give [SourceRepo.com][1] a try and let them know you heard about them from here.
