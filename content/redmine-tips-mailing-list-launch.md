As I work with my clients and their Redmine systems, I've been discovering little tricks and services they use to make Redmine better for them.  I want to share these ideas, so I'm going to be launching the [Redmine Tips mailing list][list] soon.  It will have short tips anyone can use to make Redmine easier to work with, as well as services we've found to save time and money.

To subscribe, just signup for the [Little Stream Software mailing list][list] and choose the Redmine Tips.
